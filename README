This is a small mixin for Object that allows classes to automate setting up the usual ".nonzero? or" chain of comparisons in <=>.

Usage:
  require 'easycmp'
  class MyClass
    easy_cmp :bar
    easy_cmp :@foo
    #OR easy_cmp :bar,:@foo
  end

  is equivalent to:

  class MyClass
    def <=> oth
      (self.call(:bar)<=>oth.call(:bar)).nonzero? or
        self.instance_variable_get(:@foo)<=>oth.instance_variable_get(:@foo)
    end
  end

Extras:
easy_cmp_clear will clear previously given fields. It can also be given a block to redefine <=> with.
